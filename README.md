## 1. Project Overview

The **Copernican Suite** is an evolving Python-based framework for the modular testing and comparison of cosmological models against observational data. It provides a platform for researchers to easily implement and evaluate new theories alongside the standard Î›CDM model.

This version (1.4a) marks a major architectural refactor, transforming the suite into a fully decoupled, engine-based system. This design enhances stability, simplifies development, and paves the way for future high-performance and declarative backends.

---

## 2. Installation and Requirements

The suite requires Python 3.x and several scientific libraries. To simplify setup, an automatic dependency checker runs when the program starts.

When you first run `copernican.py`, it will verify that the following required Python libraries are installed:
-   `numpy`
-   `scipy`
-   `matplotlib`
-   `pandas`
-   `psutil` (for detecting CPU cores, though no longer used by default plugins)

If any of these are missing, the script will print the necessary `pip install` commands before exiting.

---

## 3. Current Architecture (v1.4a)

The suite is designed around a **linear, decoupled pipeline** where each major component is a "black box" that communicates via a standardized JSON-based data contract (our "DSL").

-   **`copernican.py`**: The main orchestrator script. Its role is now focused purely on user interaction (getting file paths) and high-level workflow management. It discovers and allows the user to select a computational engine for the analysis.

-   **`input_aggregator.py`**: The "Assembler." This new module gathers all model and data information and serializes it into a single "Job JSON" string. This is the standardized "work order" for the engine.

-   **`cosmo_engine_*.py`**: A "Black Box" computational engine. Any file matching this pattern is a self-contained, swappable unit that:
    1.  Accepts a "Job JSON" string.
    2.  Performs all cosmological calculations and statistical fitting.
    3.  Returns a single "Results JSON" string with all findings.

-   **`output_manager.py`**: The "Renderer." This module accepts the final "Results JSON" and generates all user-facing outputs (plots, CSVs) from this data, without needing to know how the calculations were performed.

-   **`data_loaders.py`**: A modular system for parsing different SNe Ia and BAO data formats. Unchanged in v1.4a.

-   **`doc.json`**: The authoritative technical specification for the entire suite, including the formal schema for the Job/Results JSON interface.

-   **Model Plugins (`*.py`) & Definitions (`*.md`)**: The two-file system for defining new cosmological models. As of v1.4a, it is highly recommended that plugins be single-core to ensure stability.

## 4. Workflow Overview

1.  **Dependency Check**: `copernican.py` first verifies all required Python libraries are available.
2.  **Engine Selection**: The user is prompted to select which version of the `cosmo_engine` they wish to use for the analysis.
3.  **Configuration**: The user specifies the file paths for the alternative model, SNe data, and (optionally) BAO data.
4.  **Job Aggregation**: `copernican.py` passes these paths to `input_aggregator.py`, which builds the complete "Job JSON".
5.  **Engine Execution**: `copernican.py` dynamically loads the chosen engine and passes it the "Job JSON". The engine runs in isolation, performing all fits and calculations.
6.  **Output Generation**: The engine returns a "Results JSON" to `copernican.py`, which passes it to `output_manager.py` to generate all plots and data files.
7.  **Loop or Exit**: The user is prompted to run another evaluation or exit.

## 5. Development History & Roadmap

### Version 1.4a Updates (The Great Refactor)

This version represents the most significant architectural evolution of the project, achieving the long-term goal of a truly modular system.

-   **Decoupled Engine Architecture:** The core logic has been refactored into a "black box" `cosmo_engine` that communicates with the rest of the suite via a JSON-based DSL.
-   **Swappable Engines:** The main `copernican.py` script now discovers and allows the user to select any available `cosmo_engine_*.py` file, enabling easy testing of different computational backends or statistical methods in the future (e.g., `cosmo_engine_v1.5_numba.py`).
-   **Enhanced Stability:** By isolating components, bugs are easier to trace and fix. The root cause of the `multiprocessing` conflicts was identified and resolved by simplifying model plugins to be single-core, with the engine itself being the true unit of parallelization in future versions.
-   **Clear Path to Declarative Models:** The new JSON interface is the critical foundation for a future engine that can parse model equations directly from `.md` files, eliminating the need for custom `.py` plugins.

### Version 1.3 Updates (Stable Release)

This version addressed critical bugs and added significant enhancements to the data output, plot clarity, and developer framework.
-   **CRITICAL BUG FIX - BAO Plotting Restored:** Fixed a bug that caused smooth model lines on BAO plots to fail to render.
-   **New Developer Specification (`doc.json`):** Added a comprehensive `doc.json` file to act as a machine-readable "dictionary" for the suite's architecture.

### The Future Vision: A Universal Engine

The v1.4a refactor has turned this vision into a concrete, achievable goal. The next major architectural evolution will build directly on this foundation.

-   **Deprecation of `.py` Plugins:** The long-term goal is to eliminate the need for custom `model_plugin.py` files.
-   **Universal Math Engine (v1.5+):** A new, powerful engine (`cosmo_engine_v1.5_declarative.py`) will be developed that can directly parse, interpret, and solve the mathematical equations provided in the `.md` definition files using symbolic math libraries like `sympy`. It will also integrate JIT compilers like `numba` for high performance.
-   **Declarative Model Definition:** Researchers will only need to create a single, well-defined `.md` file. By specifying their model's key equations and parameters, the universal engine will handle the rest.

## 6. A Note on AI-Driven Development

> **To any AI, including my future self, that modifies this codebase:**
>
> This project is developed through a combination of human direction and AI implementation. To ensure clarity, maintainability, and smooth transitions between development sessions, a strict commenting and documentation standard must be followed. The `doc.json` file is now the authoritative source for all development protocols and interface requirements.
>
> **When modifying any file, you are required to:**
> 1.  **Add a `DEV NOTE` at the top of the file.** This note should summarize the changes made in the current version.
> 2.  **Comment the code extensively.** Explain the "why" behind your code, not just the "what".
> 3.  **Update this README file and `doc.json`**. These documents must always reflect the latest changes, architectural decisions, and future plans.
>
> Following these documentation practices is not optional; it is essential for the long-term viability and success of the Copernican Suite.
