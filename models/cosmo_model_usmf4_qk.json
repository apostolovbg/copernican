    "abstract": "This paper introduces the \"Quantum Kinematic\" version of the Unified Shrinking Matter Framework (USMFv4), a cosmological model that resolves the observational inconsistencies of its predecessor (USMFv3b). The model is founded on a new physical postulate: the rest mass of fundamental particles evolves in inverse proportion to the cosmic scale factor, $m(t) \\propto 1/a(t)$. This leads to a matter-energy density evolution of $\\rho_m(z) \\propto (1+z)^4$. This simple change has profound implications, creating a model with a direct conceptual link to quantum properties of matter, while yielding a new cosmic expansion history, $H(z) = H_0 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{m0}(1+z)^4 + \\Omega_{\\Lambda0}}$. USMFv4 is computationally robust, providing excellent fits to both Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and remains consistent with Newtonian mechanics in the low-redshift limit.",
